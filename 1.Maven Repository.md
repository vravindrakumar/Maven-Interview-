# Maven Repository

A **Maven repository** is a central location where Maven stores project libraries, plugins, and artifacts. These repositories help Maven manage dependencies for your projects. There are three types of Maven repositories:

### 1. **Local Repository**
   - **Description**: This is the repository located on your local machine, typically in the `~/.m2/repository` directory. When you build a project with Maven, it checks the local repository first to see if the required dependencies are available. If not, it fetches them from remote repositories.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - You can configure the local repository path in the `settings.xml` file located in the Maven home directory.
     - Default path: `~/.m2/repository`
     
     ```xml
     <localRepository>/path/to/local/repo</localRepository>
     ```

   **Example Workflow**: 
   - You run `mvn install`, and Maven first checks the local repository to find dependencies.

### 2. **Remote Repository**
   - **Description**: Remote repositories are hosted on a web server. They provide Maven with access to external libraries, plugins, and other artifacts. Maven central repository (`https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2`) is the default remote repository.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - You can declare additional remote repositories in the `pom.xml` if you need dependencies that are not available in Maven Central.

     ```xml
     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>central</id>
         <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
       </repository>
       <repository>
         <id>company-repo</id>
         <url>http://company.repo.url/maven2</url>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
     ```

   **Example Workflow**:
   - If a dependency is not available in the local repository, Maven will download it from the remote repository and store it in the local repository for future use.

### 3. **Central Repository**
   - **Description**: This is the official Maven repository, where most of the commonly used Java libraries and frameworks are hosted. The Central Repository is a type of remote repository but specifically managed by the Apache Maven project.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - Maven automatically connects to the Central Repository when you specify dependencies in your `pom.xml`.

     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
       <version>5.3.9</version>
     </dependency>
     ```

   **Example Workflow**:
   - Maven fetches the `spring-core` dependency from the Central Repository, downloads it, and stores it locally for future builds.

### 4. **Snapshot Repository**
   - **Description**: This is used for artifacts in development. SNAPSHOT versions are temporary and can change; they are typically used to store unstable builds.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - You can configure your `pom.xml` to allow snapshot versions of dependencies.

     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
       <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
     </dependency>
     ```

   **Example Workflow**:
   - Maven will pull the latest snapshot version of `my-app` from the remote repository if it's available.

### Summary Table

| Type               | Location            | Use Case/Example                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local Repository    | Local Machine       | Stores downloaded dependencies for future use                      |
| Remote Repository   | Remote Web Server   | Provides additional dependencies not available in Central Repo      |
| Central Repository  | https://repo.maven.apache.org | Default source for most Java libraries                             |
| Snapshot Repository | Development Build   | Stores unstable, in-development versions                            |

These repositories work together to ensure Maven can find and download all the dependencies your project needs.
